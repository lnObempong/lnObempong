### 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

🚀 I'm currently a **Front-End Web Development learner** with the [ALX Software Engineering Program](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/), where I'm building strong foundations in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

🌱 I started my journey into software engineering because:  
> _"I wanted to combine my passion for technology and public service to create digital solutions that serve real needs."_

💡 I'm especially inspired by:  
> _"the power of open-source collaboration, the impact of civic tech, and building tools for underserved communities."_

🎯 My vision is to:  
> _"bridge the gap between technology and governance to drive digital transformation in Africa."_

📌 I would love to work on:  
> _"government web portals, data visualization tools, e-learning platforms, or apps that make public services more accessible."_
